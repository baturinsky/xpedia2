  CITIES: CITIES (LORE+)
  STR_NEW_YORK_UFOPEDIA: They say that Technocracy data centers in Doom Harbor can be
    seen from space. That's an exaggeration, of course, but the sight is breathtaking
    nonetheless. This is the nexus of all Technocracy processing capacity, clearly its
    inner sanctum. One can only guess the huge amounts of data these supercomputers
    are processing on a daily basis. Some gals believe that the Technocracy central
    control core is located there, and if one could hack into it, one would be able
    to override every single last one of their cyborgs. Even if that was truly the case,
    the Technocracy core can't be approached by air, land, or sea - the defenses here
    are exactly that tight.
  STR_WASHINGTON_UFOPEDIA: Not much is known about this place - less than one would
    want to know, yet still more than what is known about other Technocracy cities.
    They say that a significant part of the Gate is one colossal concentration camp
    for the criminals, the dissidents and the downtrodden, as well as for everyone who
    wound up in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's obvious that all of these poor
    souls are converted into cyborgs, but no one knows what kind of cyborgs they become,
    which makes discussions about this place even more dread-provoking. Some rumours
    suggest something far more simple, and those people are simply drowned in the Tomac
    river that flows through the city. They also say that the former country that became
    the Technocracy in the 20th century was the first on its continent to surrender
    to the invaders, hence the city's name.
  STR_LOS_ANGELES_UFOPEDIA: 'The Boneyard was once the world''s capital of entertainment
    and used to have another name, something to the tune of ''fallen angels''. That
    would make perfect sense if one would consider the Star Gods to be angels. Angels
    did indeed fall on the city of sinners and burned it down in nuclear flame, turning
    the megalopolis into a huge charred graveyard. Nowadays this city, bustling and
    bright, is a far cry from an ashen waste. The humongous cinemas of Hollywood, the
    panoramic screens of Beverley Hills, the busy beaches of Saint Monica. Locals, sharp
    set on a glamorous life, flock to this place to either become world-class stars,
    or die an inglorious death. This is how day-to-day life looks here: the commoners
    play democracy using a voting system, while the Hubblogists render justice in the
    night. Simple as that.'
  STR_MONTREAL_UFOPEDIA: The outstanding feature of this city is a black, almost obsidian
    tower dominating the surrounding landscape. No one knows the true purpose of this
    tower, or even its origins. Legends have it that Star Gods have granted this tower
    to Canadia for some immeasurably valuable service rendered. Some say that this tower
    was erected by the Technocracy on behalf of the Star Gods; others insist that this
    majestic monument stands watch against the threat of Technocracy incursion, while
    serving as a beacon for ships. In a rather peculiar anecdote, a Guild Freighter
    crashed into the tower back in 2597. The tower remained unscathed, while the ship
    was reduced to rubble.
  STR_HAVANA_UFOPEDIA: A terrible place, its name fully deserved. Six centuries ago
    this area was bombarded heavily with experimental alien weapons. No one can tell
    for sure what kind of weaponry was used, but the consequences are plainly visible
    to this day. Bitter Coast is a reeking poisonous ruin dotted with shell craters
    and teeming with mutated creatures. The sentients here are dragging on with their
    wretched existence. Non-mutants are a very rare sight here, usually represented
    by raiding parties from the Academy, Church, Mercenaries, the Guild, and sometimes
    bandits or rich lunatics on a safari. The eponymous city is an exception, more of
    an outpost and a refueling base than a city. The settlement is protected by a special
    dome that keeps the environmental hazards and mutants at bay. The Empire doesn't
    visit this place often, although sometimes slaves undeserving of a merciful execution
    are being dropped off here.
  STR_MEXICO_CITY_UFOPEDIA: A colossal edifice of a ziggurat, its stories, adorned with
    gold and bas reliefs, serve as a foundation for a militarist society with a very
    strict hierarchy. The higher the story, the greater the social rank of its dwellers.
    This is not a place for weaklings - the art of war is taught here from early childhood,
    and those who fail to keep up descend to the lower stories that make Site slums
    look like high-end resorts. The populace is taught to worship the aztec ancestors
    and the Emperor, who is claimed to be their descendant. Praising one's higher-ups
    is seen as the right thing to do, and punishment for not doing as they tell is incredibly
    swift and brutal - also a tribute to the ancestors' ways.
  STR_CHICAGO_UFOPEDIA: In times of yore this was one of the biggest cities on Earth.
    Nowadays it's one of the largest Technocracy industrial centres, but one can only
    guess its true scale, as the 'Cracy usually places many manufacturing facilities
    underground. Although, this too is a guess, because not even the Star Gods are likely
    to know the full state of events in the cyberlands.
  STR_VANCOUVER_UFOPEDIA: A large city, yet as boring and sleepy as one could imagine.
    The port is the only part of the city displaying some activity, especially when
    some Deep Ones crawl ashore for trophies. Yet even they become dull and languid
    around these parts, lacking their legendary ferocity, and the city garrison shoots
    them off in a mundane and monotone fashion. These invasions happen three or four
    times a year. So it goes in here.
  STR_DALLAS_UFOPEDIA: Dallas D.C., the Sun City. Almost every square inch of unoccupied
    space here is covered with solar cells. This can be a dazzling sight on a sunny
    day and is why everyone on the street wears sunglasses. These sunglasses are also
    distributed amongst the slave population, with the local slave market being the
    biggest on the planet and offering workforce for every conceivable task, be it sex
    work, construction, or agricultural labor. The local ranchers' fields stretch for
    many miles around Dallas and someone must tend to them. Not that the local moneybags
    like shopping far from home.
  STR_HOPE_AND_DESPAIR_UFOPEDIA: Hopetown and Despairville are two twin cities with
    their own distinct populations. The Council of Mages of the Dominion dictate that
    happy people should live in pleasant, joy-inspiring locales and people prone to
    doldrums should live in an appropriately miserable environment. On their thirteenth
    birthday, each Dominionite (barring those to be sacrificed) is sent to one of these
    cities to be trained in a profession matching their personality type. The training
    takes about five years, and during that time the citizen is treated with magic (or
    chems) that make changing their personality impossible. It's unclear why the Dominion
    engages in this sort of stuff, but it's clearly very sinister. The residents don't
    seem to mind, though.
  STR_BOGOTA_UFOPEDIA: The Warped Stone is, true to its name, a huge twisted mountain
    whose caves house a large military base mostly used as a training camp for the Red
    Revolution's Military. There's space enough to teach all recruits everything a soldier
    worth their salt should know, from guerilla tactics to piloting aircrafts. Speaking
    of which, the local air force is not to be trifled with. It consists of at least
    20 Ordinators, and the RRM is rumored to even have an honest-to-goodness Battleship.
    That's probably lies though.
  STR_BUENOS_AIRES_UFOPEDIA: This city is distinguished by its special layout and acoustic
    properties. The Circus of Silence is built in such a way that each district is an
    almost perfect ring. Within them are spaces about four-to-six-hundred meters wide,
    inside of which no sound can escape. From space it looks like the fabled crop circles
    of yore. Our guess is that this is all part of some grandiose ritual that the mage-kings
    of the Dominion are preparing, or have already performed, or is being performed
    over some long period of time, unbeknownst to their subjects.
  STR_SANTIAGO_UFOPEDIA: The Star Gods are not too fond of the idea of honoring the
    locals who perished 600 years ago in the battle for Earth. They tried to oppose
    this tradition at first, but eventually they let it slide. That enabled the Memorial
    of the Earth, or Memoria de la Terra to be built - a sanctum city founded in memory
    of a civilization long gone. Local clergy holds the power here, whereas the Pact
    rules only in name. Pre-war memory permeates this city - mutants are not welcome
    here, as there weren't any before the war.
  STR_LIMA_UFOPEDIA: The Purgatory. Limbo. This place has many names, yet all hold the
    same meaning. Most of the city is a high security prison that holds everyone who
    for one reason or another ran afoul of the government, yet didn't merit a death
    sentence. Most prisoners are here for espionage on behalf of Dominion. Rumor has
    it that Humanist vessels sometimes show up here and haul some prisoners away, to
    unknown places and fates. Yet another oddity here is a Deep Ones camp whose purpose
    is also still unknown.
  STR_CARACAS_UFOPEDIA: There is no quieter place in the whole Revolution. This tower
    is an immense crypt where millions of souls reside in silent torment, ever watchful
    for occasional wanderers. Although, some of its residents are living, caretakers
    for this cyclopean monument and company for the spectres. This city is not as overtly
    patriotic as other Revolution settlements, if only for the sake of not stirring
    up that phantasmal hornets' nest. Should even a single voice anger them, millions
    will answer - and there will be no military parades in the Revolution after that.
  STR_LONDON_UFOPEDIA: 'Spectral: city of light, city of gates. Not the worst place
    to live if you get used to the daily risk of death, as well as the shrill whistles
    of engines and constant cannon fire. Plus, you can get yourself a clockwork butler
    who''ll clean up your pad, do your shopping, and drag you home drunk from the pub.
    Just make sure that he brings you home, and not into some hellportal or into the
    crosshairs of a gun turret. It''s actually quite beautiful here: brass platings,
    spinning cogs, peculiar mechanisms - it resembles more of a musical box than a city.
    Especially when nothing is crawling out of the portals, and you pay no mind to the
    slum-dwellers who are forced to turn the gears.'
  STR_PARIS_UFOPEDIA: Sometimes it feels like this city is shrouded in eternal night.
    The climate catastrophes of the last six hundred years are reflected in Syndicate
    City, in which it is always stormy, always pouring, and saved from flooding only
    by a system of advanced storm drains. It's a city of neon lights, cybernetic strangers,
    alleyways filled with trash, and the echoes of distant gunfire. There's little for
    us to do here without a big gun, and we better look both ways so as to not end up
    as another body ditched on the side of the road.
  STR_BERLIN_UFOPEDIA: The capital of Blackmarch, which owes its name not to a lax standard
    of morals but to the democratic nature of its local laws. This city is the seat
    of the Parliament of Blackmarch, which embodies the legislative power of the state,
    as well as all key educational and military establishments. Students and cadets
    reside in dormitories without any distinction between the two. It's inexplicable
    how soldiers-to-be manage to remain disciplined in such lenient conditions, but
    the locals claim it's precisely because the discipline is not forced upon them.
  STR_MOSCOW_UFOPEDIA: The capital of the Autonomy, which doesn't care about the other
    settlements within the country so long as they pay the proper taxes and fees. And
    in the event that the other settlements decide to teach the haughty Citadel a lesson,
    the city is well fortified against external threats. In theory, they'd be capable
    of standing against even the Star Gods for about three hours. The Black Citadel
    acquired its name after one such punitive action, in which almost the entire city
    was razed and the walls of the ancient castle in its center were blackened with
    Hellerium soot. After the armistice, it was decided that the walls would not be
    washed and would remain a memorial to the victims of the war.
  STR_ROME_UFOPEDIA: Nowadays, nothing remains here to remind us that the most powerful
    nuke blew up this city several centuries ago. Ground Zero is a conflux of luxury
    mansions, noisy fun-fairs, small shops and drinking establishments of all kinds,
    and the main venue for conferences of the governing nobility. Overall, it's a great
    place to spend your money, if you have any in comparsion with most Romanica's population.
    But this city has a dark side, and I'm not talking about the usual fare of political
    hitjobs the city's known for. Some say that the nuke didn't quite destroy everything
    that lived here before...
  STR_MADRID_UFOPEDIA: An enormous industrial hub where power is divided between the
    largest corporations of the Eurosyndicate. Much of the city is dedicated to giant
    automated factory complexes. It's said that some machines here are so monstrous
    in their size and appearance that they can drive a person insane, particularly due
    to the sinister noises they emit (hence the name of this place).
  STR_BUDAPEST_UFOPEDIA: A city-fortress that strikes the imagination with its militarization.
    Absolutely everything in this place is subordinated to the Blackmarch army - you
    can't even sneeze without military authorization. That's no exaggeration, you'll
    be jailed with charges of sternutation - what if you're a spy sending some prearranged
    signal? The city has an unbelievable stockpile of weaponry, but they won't sell
    any of it on the spot - everything goes towards the front, everything towards victory.
    This inhospitable place should be visited with caution, as the locals might load
    you into a field gun in the event of a surprise attack.
  STR_LAGOS_UFOPEDIA: Thousands of years ago, the legends state that a battle took place
    here between an evil god and a nameless titan. The giant savior fatally wounded
    the god, but in his death throes he destroyed the titan, leaving only the giant's
    now-petrified hand. A city was built around the hand, which is treated like a local
    sanctuary of some sort, as well as a nice place to rest in the shade during hot
    summer days.
  STR_CAIRO_UFOPEDIA: The capital of the Theban Hive truly resembles a hive by how crowded
    it is. And in the shadow of the Silver Pyramid, residence of the the Queen Bee herself,
    you really do feel like just an insect - with the eyes of dozens of spies on you
    at all times. The best word to describe Thebes might be... sublime. The polyfoil-topped
    lightweight structures surrounding the monolithic Pyramid forms an unimaginable
    architectural ensemble, which, as the saying goes, is a view to die for. Which might
    just end up happening - do something wrong in view of the Hive's soldiers and the
    punishment will be quick and brutal.
  STR_CASABLANCA_UFOPEDIA: Well, it's no longer right to say that it's completely abandoned,
    but for a few centuries it was a haunted place spoken of in hushed whispers by peasants
    from nearby regions. They said that four-hundred years ago, every living soul in
    the city (which had a different name, of course) just vanished in one moment. Megapol,
    the Academy, and even the Star Gods were at a loss to explain the disappearance.
    This legend still excites the minds of many and gives rise to one conspiracy theory
    after another. Nowadays you have archaeologists and tourists poking about, as well
    as the ever-present merchants who make a living off of them. It's a neat place to
    visit, though the story is pretty creepy...
  STR_PRETORIA_UFOPEDIA: Neutral ground for all of the warlords and their armies, housing
    a huge black altar in the center. Upon it sacrifices are made for luck in looting,
    races, battles, experiments, and so on. Human sacrifices, of course. The usual sacrifices
    are prisoners captured in raids from whom no fine ransom can be gotten due to their
    condition or the welfare of their loved ones. When prisoners are scarce, delinquent
    gang members are used. If they run out of those as well, the sacrifices are chosen
    from volunteers and, you know, 'volunteers'. Long story short, if the altar needs
    sacrifices, it's gonna get them.
  STR_NAIROBI_UFOPEDIA: This densely populated city grows organically in every direction,
    into the sky and down into the earth, displaying heaps of structures and contraptions
    which are sometimes literally duct taped together. The poor flock here from all
    over Africa, and as there has never been any plan or layout, it's easy to get lost
    on the ever-shifting streets. Local taxi drivers would be genius navigators and
    pathfinders - orienting yourself in a place like this demands an superhuman sense
    of direction.
  STR_CAPE_TOWN_UFOPEDIA: 'A brief description of this place would be ''a gigantic hellhole''
    - but that doesn''t convey the true scale of it. One day, the center of the city
    literally went down the drain. The reason isn''t clear, but the hole has a perfectly
    circular shape and is clearly not a product of natural causes. Once, Academy researchers
    sent down a drone installed with video recording equipment. It covered twenty kilometers
    before suddenly vanishing, not having fired a shot. The recording was heavily distorted
    due to interference, but at several points words could be heard in an unidentified
    language, as well as what would later be identified as screams for help. By decree
    of the local warlord the abyss was walled off and locals were prohibited to approach
    it under penalty of death. The cordon around the wall serves a double purpose: to
    stop those who approach the abyss, and those who try to escape it.'
  STR_KINSHASA_UFOPEDIA: 'A large city in Africa, notorious for frequent Dark One assaults.
    It''s unknown what lures the demon-possessed here. The locals have plenty of theories,
    some crazier than others: from dark artifacts to a natural portal to Hell somewhere
    beneath the city. Nobody is enthusiastic enough to discover the truth, as anybody
    who can leave Pandemonium does so at the first opportunity.'
  STR_ANKARA_UFOPEDIA: Wraithbane is a truly inhospitable place for anyone who doesn't
    fit into the worldview of the local rulers. As luck would have it, the rulers profess
    a religion that resembles that of the Church of Sirius, but slightly more radical.
    Yet their faith only privileges those of the human race, which in their view includes
    only purebloods, and only certain types of purebloods. Mutants are scarce here and
    inhabit ruins in the suburbs, as well as the slums and sewers. Also, VooDoo is strictly
    prohibited here. Even a fellow with even a little latent magical potential is branded
    as a heretic and violently executed. We oughta nuke this place someday, Cap'n.
  STR_DELHI_UFOPEDIA: The Forbidden Caves are a network of karst caves located near
    a small town of the same name. In the old days people disappeared in these caves
    all the time, but today there's a bunch of well-explored tunnels that are relatively
    safe so long as you're armed and in a group of five. Travel companies are not responsible
    for anyone who decides to go off the trail and explore the cave alone.
  STR_KARACHI_UFOPEDIA: Stonekeep is literally a stone keep. The local tribe that built
    the keep wasn't particularly inspired when naming it, but they've become quite civilized
    over the last few centuries and are doing just fine nowadays. The sturdy walls prevent
    the ubiquitous Deep One raids, and the city plays nice with all the big factions.
  STR_BAGHDAD_UFOPEDIA: 'From time immemorial this city has been an important cultural
    and scientific center that defined the development of the surrounding region. There
    is a university here, where anyone can receive a decent education (if they can afford
    it). The Academy tolerates this due to the campuses''s remoteness, political protection,
    and according to some, its usefulness - despite Academicians'' claims that they
    have no use for the ''obselete knowledge'' stored there. Current provost and chief
    archivist: Omar al-Musalim.'
  STR_TEHRAN_UFOPEDIA: The Maze is a special place. Only here, to ensure a bountiful
    harvest each year, peasants sacrifice themselves to the bloodthirsty monstrosity
    known as the Gynotaur, who dwells within the huge labyrinth nearby. According to
    legend, it's a huge creature with the head of a bull, the body of a man, and the
    tits of an Uber. It's unknown if it actually exists, but nobody ever returns from
    the labyrinth.
  STR_BOMBAY_UFOPEDIA: Named after the monument to the nameless goddess who mourns for
    the victims of the bloodthirsty, nuke-happy dictator Sunil Gandhi. Sunil came to
    power during the invasion, and under his rule the country resisted the Star Gods
    for eight years, becoming the most loyal ally of 'Russia.' His systems of denunciations
    and proscriptions allowed Gandhi to cleanse society of people he disliked in record
    time (what his standards were isn't clear), and those deemed acceptable were interned
    in factories to develop their homeland's military strength. When the tyrant and
    murderer Gandhi got whacked, many wept with happiness. Shortly after they wept from
    an unprecedented period of genocide and bloodshed directed by the Star Gods, but
    good luck finding that in the history books.
  STR_CALCUTTA_UFOPEDIA: One should be especially cautious in the Gardens of Delight,
    because an overdose of delight might cause headaches, vomiting, hallucinations and
    death. This is due to the predominance of alien vegetation brought to Earth during
    the invasion. While the locals are used to the flowers' aromas, visitors to the
    city often struggle for air, and there have been numerous fatalities. So don't pop
    into a local arboretum without some kind of rebreather. In the 24th century, the
    gardens were burned down by the extremist Muy Gontag, but since then they've regrown
    and are more impressive than ever.
  STR_TOKYO_UFOPEDIA: The only city in Fuso. Beautiful, rich, and technologically advanced,
    it stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country. The Oriental flavor can
    be tasted in the air. Local zaibatsu rule their districts with iron fists, while
    the Emperor maintains the balance between the conglomerates so that the city may
    flourish. All young adventurers who aspire to become shoguns make their way here
    to work under a corporation. Plenty of them don't last a day, but those who do often
    become truly dangerous warriors. Think twice before confronting them. As you could
    guess, the sunrises here are a sight to see.
  STR_BEIJING_UFOPEDIA: The government of the Central Province is seated here, and since
    the authorities consider the ordinary people no better than the dirt under their
    heels, only a select few can enter the city walls. There is still a high level of
    radiation in the area so the aristocracy resides underground, leaving the contaminated
    surface to their servants. Before you enter the underground chambers, you will be
    thoroughly searched in every possible place, in ways you wouldn't think of. The
    overlords of the Central Province fear for their lives, and for good reason. Though,
    at the first sight of real trouble they'd call the Star Gods for help, so perhaps
    their paranoia is a bit excessive.
  STR_BANGKOK_UFOPEDIA: Six hundred years ago, a great battle took place here between
    several Earth armies and the Star Gods. Some reports suggest this was the final
    battle of the invasion. We all know how that ended. Nowadays it's a big slum where
    residents make a living digging up rare items and artifacts from the battlefield,
    which are still valuable on the Black Market six centuries later. Some of those
    goods could probably be found in our vaults.
  STR_MANILA_UFOPEDIA: The center of the criminal underworld. Literally, as the whole
    city is built underground, and the unaware can wander around the seemingly deserted
    island for as long as can be - or as long as the guards let them. But those invited
    inside will find themselves in a neon world of eternal night, glamour, and of course,
    big money. Arenas, casinos, brothels that can serve clients with any requests. But
    don't dare visit the forbidden District 12, where drug lords house their labs and
    production facilities.
  STR_SEOUL_UFOPEDIA: The Astral Bridge is a rather unique city, as it's built upon
    giant pillars elevating the second story to fifty meters above sea level. While
    the ground level is just as toxic as the rest of the Central Province, the quality
    of life above is remarkably better. It goes without saying that the base of the
    city is home to the destitute and mutants of all kinds. A lottery is held across
    the Central Province regularly, the prize being tickets for relocation to the Astral
    Bridge, and this has proven a powerful tool to placate the masses. But of course,
    nobody actually wins.
  STR_SINGAPORE_UFOPEDIA: The most reputable place to live in the Pirate Straits. It's
    even preserved its pre-war name, which tells you something about its prestige. Singapore
    is a showpiece of a city, with the largest percentage of pureblood citizens. Many
    global factions unofficially maintain their representative offices here. All in
    all, Singapore doesn't look like a city in which nearly everything is in the tight
    grip of the mafia. But as you know, looks can be deceiving.
  STR_JAKARTA_UFOPEDIA: Don't be deceived - the 'palace' is a pile of rubble in the
    center which consists entirely of destroyed buildings and other wrecks. But freedom
    here is dime a dozen - total anarchy reigns in the city, which isn't unusual for
    the Pirate Straits. To say that here every man lives for himself is still a bit
    of an exaggeration, but the level of organizing doesn't exceed 'gang on gang.' But
    if your gang has a lot of numbers and you do organize well, it's doubtful anybody
    will try to mess with you.
  STR_SHANGHAI_UFOPEDIA: Strictly speaking, it's a hill, not a rock. And not that high,
    but a hundred meters is a hundred meters, and people of the Central Province sure
    do love their lofty names! At the top is the magnificent palace of the local prince
    that, according to some, was built in ancient times and managed to survive the invasion.
    By the 25th century the radioactivity of the area had cleared up enough that people
    were able to resettle, but the average life expectancy here is short, even for the
    Central Province. At least the local rice fields return record harvests! The noble
    and well-off, however, prefer to buy the food the Guild imports from cleaner places.
  STR_HONG_KONG_UFOPEDIA: 'Stench, scum, darkness. In a beauty contest for slums, the
    Blasphemous Port would place dead last. Clean food, clean water, and clean air are
    valuable commodities here; human life is considerably cheaper. One can rub up against
    plenty of shady characters here, willing to do anything for a hit of crack or a
    couple of chips. Many have wondered why this place hasn''t been completely leveled
    at some point, but the answer is obvious: somebody in a high place is making a mint
    off of it.'
  STR_NOVOSIBIRSK_UFOPEDIA: An autonomy within the Autonomy. Legends speak of this city
    as a cradle of science and progress, but nowadays there's hardly anything left to
    be called science, and absolutely no trace of the city's history of rebellious mages.
    Around 2186 the Star Gods determined that the local magical community had forgotten
    their place, and, with the blessing of the Solar Governor, obliterated the city.
    Only its name survived. Since then, no witches have been seen in the city that once
    made them its namesake. Although... it's whispered that somewhere in the suburbs
    there is an underground magic market, hidden so deeply that it'd be useless to try
    to find it on our own.
  STR_CANBERRA_UFOPEDIA: In a country such as the Death Realms, you'd think a 'secret
    arena' would be an oxymoron. This one in particular is a double-oxymoron since the
    Secret Arena hosts an entire city around it. In general, it's hard to figure out
    what the hell the people here are talking about. The titular arena is secret because
    magic, energy weapons, and other dirty tricks are permitted.
  STR_WELLINGTON_UFOPEDIA: 'This coastal town is clearly a pirate bay. Loud, crowded,
    and lively, with two pirate lords in charge: Tal and Smal. The former is in charge
    of war and defense; the latter running trade and the economy. Their partnership
    allowed the creation of a prosperous city-state where anyone who doesn''t want to
    live under the yoke of the Star Gods can find real freedom and a job to their heart''s
    content. Also, there''s a real zoo, where we can see such exotic beasts like lieons,
    evilphants, spitcupines, spearrows, and even the feargaroo.'
  STR_MELBOURNE_UFOPEDIA: To Death Realmers, Terminus is a sacred city. It's here that
    Jesus Reist, the legendary gladiator revered as a deity, won his victories. A prodigious
    cross-shaped temple was built in his honor, shaped to resemble the weapon he fought
    with. Among local peasants it's widely believed that one day the reincarnation of
    Jesus Reist will walk the earth. She will be the only survivor of a nightmarish
    battle, born in a distant land to uncertain parents, and will lead the people against
    the Star Gods to wipe them from the face of the earth. Cap'n, isn't that you?
  STR_PERTH_UFOPEDIA: It's obvious that dying in the Death Realms is easy, but that's
    especially true in Devil's Lair. On the surface, the city is what passes for ordinary.
    But some weird devil shit happens frequently in the catacombs below, such as gravitational
    anomalies, optical illusions, and otherworldly screams that drive people mad. Electronics
    go crazy and recordings get distorted. Fortunately for the local peasants, none
    of this phenomena has been detected above the catacombs in the past five centuries
    of observation.
  STR_HELSINKI_UFOPEDIA: 'Should you find yourself in Hel, you''ll definitely need a
    hazmat suit, or at least a gas mask. The reason: the stench of fish that saturates
    every single thing here. Buildings, vehicles, trees, pedestrians; even the local
    hoes stink of fish. Only the elites don''t reek, but they still give off the faint
    scent of seafood. Alas, it''s apparently the unavoidable cost for the city''s wealth,
    which is based on deep sea fishing.'
  STR_CONSTANTINE_UFOPEDIA: 'Constantine is the biggest trade hub in Europe. This is
    largely due to the stewardship of one of Romanica''s oldest aristocratic families.
    The Family (yeah, with a capital) survived the invasion and subsequent decline of
    civilization. Despite its power, the Family is in a rather difficult position: although
    even the Guild and the Black Market cozy up to them (an incredible feat for an earthbound
    organization), the rest of the Romanic aristocracy see them as collaborators and
    traitors. None of this is said openly, however. Under the current order of things,
    everybody''s happy, and if it''s ruined - nobody wants to know what will come next.'
  STR_KARAGAND_UFOPEDIA: The Crossroads is a commercial oasis in the vast Central Asian
    desert. Most roads, if not all, lead here; you can find almost any goods on the
    market, even those prohibited by the Star Gods. For obvious reasons, the black market
    items are not advertised. It's generally a great place to sell our loot since it's
    easy to get to.
  STR_KARAKORUM_UFOPEDIA: The capital-fortress of the desert's proud rulers. You can
    refuel the ship, replenish your supplies, have a hearty chat, and have a couple
    shots of kumiss. But in general, you ought to steer clear of this place as Turanians
    are unpredictable folks. From the top of the tower you can get a breathtaking view
    of the desert, but dress warmly - the nights are very cold.
  STR_VLADIVOSTOK_UFOPEDIA: Due to some unexplained anomaly, this city is always as
    bright as mid-day, earning its name of Northern Lights. Another question is the
    land on which it stands - both Fuso and the Autonomy claim it as their own sovereign
    territory. There are frequent scraps between Fusanese recon squads and the Autonomous
    Border Forces in the city's outskirts. Due to the former's poverty and the latter's
    remoteness, their skirmishes look more like a knife fight in a bar than an armed
    conflict between nations.
  STR_JERUSALEM_UFOPEDIA: The Most Ancient City on the Planet - that's what everybody
    says about it. Even in official media, which tends to be pretty serious. It's difficult
    for us to consider how much of it has changed, even in comparison to the Invasion
    period. There are still a lot of old, old buldings and sculptures here, and the
    whole city gives the impression of a museum. Only the Hive's soldiers spoil the
    scenery a bit, but a true connoisseur won't even notice them. Plus, they protect
    the ancient sites from looting. Speaking of which... well, it'd be great loot, but
    security here's so tough that it's off the table.
  STR_HOPE_AND_DESPAIR: Hopetown & Despairville
  STR_INDEPENDENT_CITIES: INDEPENDENT CITIES
  STR_INDEPENDENT_CITIES_UFOPEDIA: Not every city on our planet obeys the local governments.
    Some of them are powerful enough to pursue their own goals and keep independence
    (but only from local govts, not the Star Gods). Some places are too miserable and
    creepy to live in, so no sane government would like to have them within their borders.
    Anyway, looks like we have to visit those cities from time to time for various reasons.
    Keep in mind that our efforts in kicking the Big Three’s asses and protecting free
    mutants from tyranny will still be monitored in such places, Cap'n.
  STR_POSTCARD: COLLECTIBLE CARDS
  STR_POSTCARD_UFOPEDIA: A set of a dozen colorful postcards with cityscapes. Educational
    info is written on the back of each card for wealthy tourists and fans of official
    history. The fine print on the bottom states that they were all printed in Mr. DZ's
    publishing house. Also there is some gibberish, consisting of random numbers and
    letters separated by dots. We took the effort to input this into the computer...
    and found ourselves in the deep realms of the Ethyrnet, where anonymous truth crusaders
    archive mysterious and unofficial facts about our world’s history.
